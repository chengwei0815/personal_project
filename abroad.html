                    wonderful. I realize a trip like this takes a lot of time and effort to organize and I just wanted to acknowledge to you
                    how grateful I am that Henry was part of the Bangor Chinese summer program. For Henry, everything went so smoothly! I
                    would also like to acknowledge the graciousness of the host families. Henry learned a lot from each one of the families
                    and left China with a number of sincere friendships. Henry considered his host families the same as his own family. It
                    was nice to hear all about the traditions and care they took on behalf of Henry. It was certainly a trip of a lifetime!"</p>

                    <p>"Hello, I want you to know how wonderful the trip was for Tyler and how excited he is to apply to the year
                        long program.
                        Tyler loved the trip. The trip was well organized, properly chaperoned, and had a high quality of learning
                        involved.
                        Tyler appreciated having homework and deadlines because it helped him manage his learning. He thought
                        everyone worked
                        hard to provide a educational and cultural experience. It is an amazing program that should be offered to
                        students in
                        Maine. I hope more students will take this great opportunity."</p>

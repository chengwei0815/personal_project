    <section class="programs">
        <p>With fifteen (15) years of experience in STARTALK Chinese teacher training, <br>the Bangor Chinese School/CLCCM offer this
        program to provide professional/best practice to teachers to improve their daily teaching in the classroom, <br>and to reach
        each of their goals in teaching Chinese language and culture to our young generation.</p>
        <div class="row">
            <div class="programs-col">
                <h3>Program Description</h3>
                <p>This is an intensive three-week (meeting on the site for two weeks) professional development program for current and
                prospective teachers of Chinese or other foreign languages. The goal is to strengthen participants' theoretical
                knowledge and practical experience about teaching Chinese as a foreign language. Learners will become familiar with the
                National Standards, ACTFL Guidelines, our State Education Department's foreign language objectives, international
                standards in teaching Chinese, and methods used in implementing these standards in the classroom. Participants will have
                the opportunity to teach lessons to real students and receive feedback from both their peers and professional
                development specialists.</p><p>
                At the conclusion of this program, students should be able to develop standards-based, culturally-rich units and lesson
                plans, integrate assessment strategies, culture, and technology in their teaching, and differentiate instruction for
                diverse learners. The teachers will develop new instructional strategies and have more hands-on experiences in
                motivating and engaging students in learning Chinese language and culture.</p>

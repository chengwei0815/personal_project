                <h3>Bangor Chinese School celebrates the year of the rabbit (1/22/2023)</h3>
                <p>BANGOR, Maine — People came together in Bangor Sunday afternoon to welcome the Chinese New Year. The year of the rabbit
                is expected to bring some calmness to our lives, as it symbolizes peace, happiness, and health.<br>

                The Bangor Chinese School held the gathering which consisted of student performances, Chinese medicine demonstrations,
                and holiday food.<br>


                "That is so meaningful, so important for the local young people and even adults to know more about the Chinese culture,"
                Jing Zhang, president of the Bangor Chinese School, said.<br>

                The celebration was not limited to families involved with the school. Stephen Myers said he wanted to attend the
                celebration because he has a close connection to Chinese culture.<br>

                Myers moved to China with his family when he was young, and he lived there for 25 years. Myers moved back to Maine last
                year, but he said the Chinese culture remains important to him.<br>

                "You live someplace for a long time, then it becomes kind of a part of you," he added.<br>

                As one's culture can bring a sense of belonging, cultural differences around the world are also bringing division. That
                divide shows us how critical it is to try and be accepting and understanding.<br>

                For Zhang, she said it's part of her mission to teach people about Chinese traditions, viewpoints, and beliefs.

                "I think as a Chinese American, [we have] an obligation to share the language and the culture," Zhang said.</p>

                <h3>Kids learning second language this summer at Bangor Chinese School (6/27/2022)</h3>
                <p>BANGOR, Maine (WABI) - School is out for the summer for most kids, but for some it means picking up a second language at
                the Bangor Chinese School's dragon camp.<br>

                Students of all ages started day one of Chinese immersion camp Monday.

                The program with the Chinese Language and Culture Center of Maine has been around for about 20 years.<br>

                “What we are doing is if they can speak Chinese well and they know Chinese culture meanwhile we can go to China to share
                the same good things about this side to Chinese children and then after that time everything will be easier to figure
                out,” said Jing Zhang, Bangor Chinese School president.<br>


                Younger students start camp learning the basics like how to say hello and introduce themselves.

                While more advanced students practice writing and their understanding of the language.

                Zhang says they are happy to be back to in-person learning.

                “We are working face to face, we are moving around, and then our eyes get relaxed and the whole mental thing is relaxed
                so we are laughing together, we are working together, and we are in action together,” Zhang said.<br>


                Zhang says they hope to prepare a younger generation to be bilingual - allowing them to enhance future relations between
                China and the United States.<br>

                “If you can only speak one language you only can know one world, if you can speak two languages your world is doubled,
                your resources, everything and even the chance of success is doubled,” Zhang said.</p>

                <h3>Celebrate the Chinese Lunar New Year (2/2/2022)</h3>
                <p>BANGOR — As we head into the new month, celebrations are underway to welcome the Year of the Tiger, also known as the
                Chinese Lunar New Year.

                The Chinese Lunar New Year is celebrated within many Chinese and Asian countries based on the lunar calendar.

                The lunar calendar assigns an animal from the rotating zodiac sign of 12 animals.<br>

                Starting Feb. 1, we say goodbye to the ox and hello to the Year of the Tiger.

                “We know that the tiger is a king of the animal world and that means the king will protect the people,” Jing Zhang,
                Bangor Chinese School founder. “It brings smart, positive and happy things to a human being.”<br>


                Zhang made the big move from Beijing, China to Bangor more than 20 years ago.

                She said the holiday is known to celebrate good fortune, prosperity, family gatherings and traditional food.

                “There's so many things going. There's a big table of food to share, they play the firecrackers, and then they knock on
                the door wishing a Happy New Year to everyone,” said Zhang.

                Bangor High School Chinese teacher Chun “Lily” Crane said this is a time to celebrate but also a time to educate.<br>

                “The red envelope is normally given from adults to kids and can be also young people to elderly people,” said Crane.
                “It's a symbol of good luck. My students get this from me every year and they can see the money in it and learn about
                the currency.”

                From fried rice to oranges and lanterns, Crane's students had the opportunity to get a taste of what the Chinese culture
                is like.

                “A lot of times I try to bring in things I know and things I like about the culture,” said Crane. “I want to share with
                them so they can have real experience of learning the language combined with the culture.”

                The BangorChinese school will be commemorating the Year of the Tiger at Husson University on Saturday,Feb. 5.</p>

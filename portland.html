                <h1>Portland Chinese School of CLCCM</h1><br>
                <h4>Why Portland Chinese School?</h4>
                <p>BANGOR, Maine (March 12, 2012) Jing Zhang, Executive Director of the Chinese Learning and
                Culture Center of Maine (CLCCM), and Dr. Suzhong Tian, President of the Bangor Chinese
                School, are pleased to announce that their Bangor-based educational programs are being
                extended to four new locations in Portland, South Portland, Saco and Brunswick. The Portland
                Chinese School (PCS), a new unit under the Center’s organizational umbrella, has been created to
                provide the Bangor School’s successful standards-based curriculum in southern Maine locations.
                This will ensure high-quality, immersion-intensive instruction in Chinese language and culture for all
                ages and all levels with flexible class schedules. Instruction is now beginning in April 5th in four
                locations: Portland, South Portland, Saco and Brunswick.<br>
                CLCCM and its educational wing, the Bangor Chinese School, have built external support and
                partnerships with a number of organizations including schools, universities, businesses, private
                donors, non-governmental organizations, local government, state government, federal government
                and international organizations. A Bangor-based Confucius Classroom is being established
                following the visitation of a Chinese delegation to the Center and a number of Maine schools.
                Strong working partnerships have helped CLCCM expand its educational service mission and offer
                new services.<br>
                Dr. James T. Kenny, CLCCM board member reports, “Chinese language instruction within the
                State of Maine needs to keep pace with the State’s business and commercial advancements in the
                global community. International trade is one of the fastest growing sectors of the Maine economy
                as the state currently ranks ninth in the nation’s export growth to China.”
                Offerings at the southern locations will be school-year Chinese language lessons for people of all
                ages and all levels in the language. Summer learning programs, guided tours of China s and
                exchange programs, and assistance to schools in setting up Chinese program will also be offered
                in the area.<br>
                CLCCM’s executive director, Zhang notes, that, “As Maine’s largest urban area, Portland and its
                surrounding communities have been seeking high quality Chinese language instruction.” CLCCM’s
                Chinese School is prepared to help fill this gap. With ever-increasing communication and cooperation between Maine and China, it is hoped that the Center will be an important player in
                building a bridge between the two countries.</p>

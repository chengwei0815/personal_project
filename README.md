Reflection:
What was the context for this project?
The STARTALK program is a federally funded initiative aimed at teaching critical languages to students. The program's website was outdated and difficult to navigate, resulting in low engagement and frustration for users. As a web designer and a supporter of the STARTALK program, I decided to take on the project of redesigning the website to better serve the needs of its users.

What did you set out to build?
I set out to redesign the STARTALK website to improve the user experience, navigation, and accessibility. The website needed to be more user-friendly, visually appealing, and easy to navigate for teachers, students, and parents seeking information about the STARTALK program and its offerings.

Why was this project challenging and therefore a really good learning experience?
The project was challenging because I had to balance the needs and expectations of various stakeholders, including the STARTALK program administrators, language teachers, students, and parents. I had to consider the different types of information that users might be looking for, and design a navigation structure that would make it easy to find what they needed. I also had to consider the technical constraints of the existing website, and find creative solutions to address them.

What were some unexpected obstacles?
One unexpected obstacle was the need to accommodate multiple languages on the website. Because STARTALK supports the learning of critical languages, it was important to provide information in a variety of languages. This required me to design a flexible system for managing content in multiple languages, and to ensure that the design could accommodate different text lengths and character sets. Another unexpected obstacle was ensuring that the website was responsive and mobile-friendly.

What tools did you use to implement this project?
 I am using a text editor to write HTML, CSS, and JavaScript code. I also used a variety of design tools, including Sketch and Figma, to create wireframes and mockups. To ensure compliance with accessibility guidelines, I used accessibility tools to test the website for compliance with accessibility standards. In addition, I consulted with STARTALK staff and participants to gather feedback and incorporate their suggestions into the design.
